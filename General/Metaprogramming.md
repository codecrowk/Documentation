Metaprogramming can be used to move computations from runtime to compile time

---------------

One approach to metaprogramming is using macros. Macros are a way to define reusable code snippets that can be expanded at compile time. They allow you to write code that generates other code, enabling you to abstract complex logic or repetitive patterns into concise and reusable constructs.

Another approach is using code annotations or attributes. Annotations are metadata that you can attach to classes, methods, or properties to provide additional information or instructions to the compiler or runtime. With annotations, you can define custom behaviors, generate code, or perform validations or transformations based on the annotated elements.

Metaprogramming also opens the door to domain-specific languages (DSLs). A DSL is a programming language specifically designed to solve problems in a particular domain or industry. With metaprogramming, you can create your own DSLs tailored to your specific needs, providing a higher level of abstraction and expressiveness.

As you can see, metaprogramming is a powerful tool in the hands of a skilled programmer. It allows you to go beyond the limitations of traditional programming and unleash your creativity.
