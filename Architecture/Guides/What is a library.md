## Why use Libraries?

- The main reason for using libraries is re-usability. All we need to do is use one function call and a whole task will be performed that would otherwise require code ranging from several to several dozen lines.
- Most libraries contain functions that the ordinary user would not be able to re-create. Without the use of these libraries each user would have to understand the inner workings of each aspect of their respective programming language. Keep in mind that the libraries you use so casually were developed by professionals with years of experience.
- Another obvious benefit is the significant decrease in time required for coding.
