If you only want to share behaviour across a set of software entities, use an **interface**

If you want to share implementation and behaviour, use an **abstract class** instead

------

Use an abstract class to model an is-a relationship and share a common implementation with all subclasses.

Use an interface to represent a contract to which other classes must adhere.
